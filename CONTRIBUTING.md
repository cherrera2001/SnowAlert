## Developing a new Alert Handler

An alert is a module that has a `handle` function, which takes an alert and extra data to describe how it should be
handled. The handler uses its argument names to declare what subest of the following data it wants â€”

  `alert` - dict representation of the VARIANT in the fields of the `results.alerts:ALERT` column
  `correlation_id` - the VARCHAR value in the fields of the `results.alerts:CORRELATION_ID` column
  `alert_count` - the NUMBER value in the fields of the `results.alerts:COUNTER` column
  `...alert['HANDLERS'][n]` - all of the keys defined alert handler being called, passed in as keyword arguments

The `handle(...)` function performs whatever requirements necessary for the alert handling. It succeeds if it returns
a value and does not succeed if calling it throws an exception. Regardless, the results will be recorded in an array
in the `results.alerts:HANDLED` column that is parallel to the `results.alerts:ALERT:HANDLERS` array.

For example:

- the Jira handler creates a Jira ticket or updates a correlated alert's Jira ticket in the project it is set up via
ENV vars to run, i.e. `handle(alert, correlation_id, ...)`, and
- the Slack handler reads API keys from an env var and the `channel` from the keys in the alert's `HANDLERS`, i.e.
`handle(alert, channel=None, ...)`.

Note that in the second case, the "channel" value is created dynamically by alerts that define a Slack handler, and
thus needs to have a default value in order for alert queries without that value create non-failing alerts. Failing
alerts should be avoided and may be automatically retried in the future.



A new handler should be placed in the plugins directory; you should ensure that the name of the handler file is
"<service>.py"; i.e. a handler which sends messages to Slack would be called slack.py.
